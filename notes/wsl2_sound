To disable the beep in bash you need to uncomment (or add if not already there) the line set bell-style none in your /etc/inputrc file.

Note: Since it is a protected file you need to be a privileged user to edit it (i.e. launch your text editor with something like sudo <editor> /etc/inputrc).

To disable the beep also in vim you need to add set visualbell in your ~/.vimrc file.

To disable the beep also in less (i.e. also in man pages and when using "git diff") you need to add export LESS="$LESS -R -Q" in your ~/.profile file.
